# JS-Advanced
All the labs and exercise tasks that I have finished in my JavaScript Advanced course in SoftUni.

Most of these are gonna be just the code for the task without the server needed to run them. You can take a look at how I solve them but mostly not run them live.

Everything else beside the finished tasks code in the .js files is provided by SoftUni and is here and is intended only for viewing and/or study purposes.
